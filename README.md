# Introduction-to-Spark-Streaming-Real-Time-Network-Traffic-Analysis-for-Telecommunications

**Problem Statement**

A telecommunications company wants to monitor its network traffic in real-time to identify any
anomalies or patterns that could indicate issues or opportunities for improvement. The company
has a large volume of network traffic data generated every second and needs to process this
data in real-time. They also want to be able to visualize the data to provide insights to the
network operation team.

We will develop a real-time network traffic analysis system using Apache Kafka and Structured
Spark Streaming. The system will ingest and process network traffic data in real-time and
identify any anomalies or patterns. The data will be visualized using a web-based dashboard
that provides real-time insights into the network traffic.

**Hints**
● Set up a Kafka cluster on Confluent Cloud and configure Kafka topics for ingesting
network traffic data.

● Use Structured Spark Streaming to ingest data from Kafka topics and perform real-time
analytics on the data.

● Implement stateless transformations such as select, filter, and groupBy to analyze the
data in real-time.

● Use sliding window operations and window-based aggregations to identify any patterns
or anomalies in the data.

● Visualize the data using a web-based dashboard such as Streamlit or Grafana.

**Guidelines**

● Set up a Kafka cluster on Confluent Cloud and create two Kafka topics named
network-traffic and processed-data.

● Implement a Python script using the kafka-python package to generate network traffic
data and publish it to the network-traffic Kafka topic.

● Use Structured Spark Streaming to ingest data from the network-traffic Kafka topic and
perform real-time analytics on the data.

● Implement a sliding window operation to identify patterns in the data, such as sudden
spikes or drops in traffic.

● Use a window-based aggregation to identify any anomalies in the data, such as
unexpected patterns or traffic from unusual sources.

● Publish the processed data to the processed-data Kafka topic.

● Use Grafana to visualize the processed data in real-time. Create graphs that show traffic
trends, identify any issues, and provide insights to the network operation team.

You can use the following sample code to generate network traffic data and publish it to the
Kafka topic. However, you’ll need to write code for ingesting and processing the data in
real-time.
